# Login-4

A React-Vite Login project created with the help of FireBase.

The project is based on FireBase and includes Authentication.

In the project, React Router Dom was used for inter-page routing and React Toastify was used for warnings and notifications.

You can add a FireBase folder with your own information to a simple project and create your own project, use different libraries for formatting, and create areas where you can change personal information such as username and password with the help of the FireBase document.

The Gif file containing short screenshots of the project is attached below.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
